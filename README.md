# ELIXIR_containers_nextflow

ELIXIR VIB-CRG courses on containers (Docker + Singularity) and Nextflow.

## When & Where ?

Mon 11 & Tue 12 May 2020, Clemenspoort Ghent (confirmed). 

## Target audience

Bioinformaticians with no or little knowledge of containers.

## Requirements



## Format

2 full days, organized as follows:
* Day 1: containers
  * Introduction to containers
    * History of containers
    * What are containers? Why use them?
    * Containers vs virtual machines
  * Docker
    * Installation ?
    * Images and containers
    * Docker architecture
    * Docker files, Docker image layers, Docker caching
    * Docker hub: get images from and load images to: *push, pull*
    * Build and run Docker image from existing recipe:
      * Use Docker image interactively
      * Checking running containers, stopping an starting containers: *ps, rm*
      * Remove images: *rmi*
      * Exporting containers into tar files and importing them back
      * Tagging an image: *tag*
    * Docker "recipes":
      * Understand the main sections: *FROM, RUN, ADD, ENV, CP*
      * Write basic recipe: e.g. Ubuntu base layer + ncbi-blast
      * Build and run
    * Working with volumes: *docker run -v ...*
    * ...
  * Singularity
    * Installation ?
    * Differences between Singularity and Docker: why and when to use one or the other. Pros and cons.
    * Singularity "recipes"
    * Building a basic Singularity image
    * Pull and run an image with Singularity, from Docker hub
    * Use Singularity image interactively: *singularity shell*
    * Volumes in Singularity
    * ...
    
* Day 2: Nextflow
  * Installation ?
  * Simple Nextflow pipeline given as an example:
    * Run pipeline
    * Go more in details: understand the config and pipeline (.nf) files, check standard output, ...
    * Modify pipeline, run again
  * Basic concepts: processes, channels, operators
  * Write and run a simple Nextflow pipeline (e.g. print text, process a simple calculation)
  * Including Singularity containers in Nextflow pipelines
  * ...
  

## Learning objectives

* Learn the concept of containers: what is a container, what is an image ?
* Understand the difference between Docker and Singularity
* Understand a container's "recipe"
* Learn about Docker hub
* Understand Nextflow's basic concepts: processes, channels, ...
* Learn how to write and run a Nextflow pipeline

## Learning outcomes

* Docker images and containers: run, push, pull, remove
* Write Docker recipe
* Build and run Docker image
* Pull and push Docker container to / from Docker hub
* Pull Docker container as Singularity image
* Write and run a simple Nextflow pipeline
* Write and run a simple Nextflow pipeline using a Singularity container
