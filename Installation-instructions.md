# Installation instructions

For this course we've set up a couple of Virtual Machines, i.e. virtual Ubuntu computers, on a server. 
Each participant has to install a VNC software that allows you to connect to that VM with an individual login & password. 

Connect to the VM:
- Download [VNC Viewer for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vnc%C2%AE-viewer-for-google-ch/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla/related) (or any other VNC software that works for you). 
- Enter the address (IP-address:Port-number), e.g.; 35.110.512.24:5901
- Click on connect and use the password when prompted, e.g.: TrainingVIB1

Not working? Here are some troubleshooting tips: 
- Are you on a company's network? Try to make a VPN to a different location.
- Are you working from home? It's possible that your home network/computer blocks the ports 5901-5905. [This guide](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-open-port-windows-firewall) explains to you how to enable the port.
